# Kubernetes Tutorials
These are some things I tried out and discovered when exploring the fascinating world of Kubernetes.
I often talk about these things to friends, etc. and it helps to give folks a place to go for
more information and/or concrete examples.

Not all tutorials will be specifically for Kubernetes.  Anything related to cloud computing is fair game.

NOTE to self: maybe rename this to Cloud Computing Tutorials.
